# Disclaimers



Please be aware of the following before depositing an incentive:

1. Incentives below $15K USD value will be converted
2. Pools with less than 0.15% of the total votes on the Beethoven-X Snapshot will not get any BEETS allocation
3. You are responsible for being aware of all [Beethoven-X voting rules](https://docs.beethovenx.io/beets/gauge-vote-for-pool-incentives) and keeping up with any changes to these rules. All deposits will be distributed to voters of the selected pool regardless of final vote impact.
4. VoteHoven will offers a delegation service for fBEETS holders. If you're a buyer, anyone who votes for your desired pool, whether delegated or not, is eligible for a share of your deposited incentive. As for VoteHoven's delegation vote, we take into consideration the current vote totals and may not allocate as many votes if the rewards are already diluted. We also reserve a small allocation for Beethoven-X pools, for the betterment of the Beethoven-X ecosystem.
