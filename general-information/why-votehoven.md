# Why VoteHoven

VoteHoven is an incentives platform where **fBEETS** holders can receive compensation from buyers interested in amassing voting power. Delegating/Voting on Snapshot incurs no risk to user funds, you always retain custody of your **fBEETS**.

Buyers can easily set the amount they are willing to pay in total for users to vote for their pool.

&#x20;**fBEETS** holders can vote on Snapshot for their preferred incentive, or soon delegate their **fBEETS** to **VoteHoven**. We will choose the best incentive(s) on every proposal, so that you can delegate, sit back and enjoy the rewards without doing any work.&#x20;

The delegation process and the incentive structure makes the platform straightforward and easy to capitalize on for both **fBEETS** holders and vote buyers.&#x20;
