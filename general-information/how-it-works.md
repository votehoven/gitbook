# How it works

A window to the buyers & voters will be opened for each proposal on Beethoven-X's Snapshot space and will work like so:



_Delegators who wish for VoteHoven to vote for them are only required to delegate their votes **once** and will have their share registered on **all future incentives.** You can also choose to vote manually yourself, even if you are delegated._

{% content-ref url="../explainers/voter-manual.md" %}
[voter-manual.md](../explainers/voter-manual.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

1. When a new Beethoven-X Snapshot proposal begins, it will be listed on VoteHoven.com to receive incentives.
2. **Buyers** select their token to pay with, the amount to pay & which pool they would like the users to vote for.
3. A buyer can enter their incentive and increase it until the Beethoven-X Snapshot proposal is over.
4. VoteHoven votes on behalf of their delegators, and confirms the number of fbeets (including undelegated fbeets) votes cast on the buyer's behalf.
5. The incentive is distributed among the voters via a claim on the app.
