# Quickstart Guide

This guide is meant to help users jump into the VoteHoven ecosystem asap, please read the Voter Manual for a more comprehensive walkthrough and more details that are missing from this guide.&#x20;



1. Start earning extra incentives with your BEETS: Lock your BEETS for fBEETS on [Beethoven-X](https://beets.fi/#/stake).
2. **Vote manually** on Snapshot after incentives are deposited to VoteHoven (when the proposal is live). For example, here is illustrated a DAI incentive of 9,500 DAI. To receive a share of the incentive you will have to vote for Sigma's Wrapped Symphony on the Beethoven-X Snapshot proposal. You can click on the button on the bottom of the card to take you to the Beethoven-X Snapshot space.

#### It is recommended for users with a relatively small fBEETS position to vote manually for their preferred incentive, to prevent the need to withdraw a small amount of many different tokens.

3\. That's it! all you have to do is wait for the proposal to end, and the incentives will appear on the VoteHoven claim page \~24-48 hours after the proposal is over!
