# Voter Manual

This is the VoteHoven dashboard:

The dashboard will house all of your possible actions as a delegator. Make sure you connect your wallet with the **Connect** button on the top right, and connect to the Fantom Opera network to start using VoteHoven.

### **VOTING**

To be eligible for a reward, you can either vote for the buyer's selected pool on the Beethoven-X Snapshot space, or delegate your **fBEETS** to VoteHoven, and we will do the voting for you.

To vote manually, check out the incentives, choose the one you would like to receive and vote for it on Snapshot. You don't have to vote 100% of your weight for the incentivized pool. The share of the incentive you receive will be relative to the % of the voting power you allocated to the pool (You could choose to receive a share of different incentives this way for example).

For example, here is illustrated a $DAI incentive of 9,500 $DAI. To receive a share of the incentive you will have to vote for Sigma's Wrapped Symphony on the Beethoven-X Snapshot proposal. You can click on the button on the bottom of the card to take you to the Beethoven-X Snapshot space.

To delegate to VoteHoven, use the **Delegate ⚡** button on the right. Alternatively you can also and delegate to the following address: , or to delegate via the Snapshot UI. These are all different ways of doing the same transaction, which interacts with the Snapshot smart contract and will only be required **once**.

Once delegated, **Your Delegated Amount** will display the amount of your locked BEETS being delegated (Due to how Snapshot works, you can only delegate 100% of your BEETS).

You can still vote manually after you've delegated to VoteHoven. Voting manually on a proposal will temporarily prohibit delegation for said proposal. You are still delegated to VoteHoven for all other and future proposals. You will receive the incentive of the pools you voted for (if there are incentives deposited for them through VoteHoven).

_If you wish to remove your delegation permanently, you can do so at_ _​_[https://snapshot.org/#/delegate](https://snapshot.org/#/delegate)

**Total Delegated** displays the sum of all BEETS delegated to VoteHoven.

### CLAIMING REWARDS

To claim your rewards, press the **Claim Rewards** button, and you will arrive at the claim page. The rewards are distributed via a claim button \~24h-48h after the end of the proposal.
